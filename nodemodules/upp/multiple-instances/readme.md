# Multiple Instances

This example uses Uppy with the RestoreFiles plugin.
It has two instances on the same page, side-by-side, but with different `id`s so their stored files don't interfere with each other.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the root repository:

```bash
npm install
```

Move into this directory, then:

```bash
npm start
```
